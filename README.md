# Taquin game

For the game, the picture is coming from a [website](https://picsum.photos/300/300) that generates random pictures, your gallery or your phone (you can choose where come from your pic on the setting of the app)

To play the taquin, you can click on one of the square or slide with your finger on Taquin to move the square. 

 If you click on the setting button &#9881; on the left bottom of the taquin, you can see a pop-up with different settings for the game :
 - Slider size of the taquin : change the size from 2 to 10
 - Difficulty level of the game : easy, medium, difficulty
 - Where come from the pic 
 - Display the number on the squares 

If you click on the reload button &#128260; on the center bottom of the taquin, you can reload the taquin game. 

If you click on the go back button â†© [](#) on the left bottom of the taquin, you can come back from a move you did and the counter, on the top of the taquin, will substract the number from one occurency.
